<h1>Birdnest</h1>
<p>
birdnest is a Twitter API proxy which filter out the unnecessary information off the Twitter response. This result better utilization of bandwidth for Twitter mobile client, primarily for <a http="http://sugree.com/project/jibjib">jibjib</a>.

<h2>What is birdnest?</h2>
<p>
Normally, Twitter does provide various methods to enable flexible access and interact with Twitter via its API. Many mobile clients are created in order to increase the tweet channel and help people tweet more frequent. However, Twitter API is not tailored for just mobile purpose. Return message of many methods become bloat and use too much bandwidth than it should be. For example, you may don't want to know anything except than name of twitter-er who just replied to you at 30 seconds ago.

<p>
Size of the returned data directly effects the network cost, EDGE or GPRS. Specialized proxy that forward the request to the Twitter and throw away any unnecessary data before send it back to the client is required to decrease the data size and that become birdnest.

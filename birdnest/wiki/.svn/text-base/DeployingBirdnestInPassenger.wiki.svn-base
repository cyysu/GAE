#summary Deploying Birdnest  with Phusion Passenger
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Currently deployment of http://nest.onedd.net is done using Phusion Passenger. Although Passenger aims for easier deploying rails application, it also support WSGI as the proof-of-concept. Therefore, we can use it for deploying WSGI apps also, including birdnest.

= Steps to deploy =

1. Install Apache and Phusion Passenger.

2. Setup the Application path. eg. /var/nest

3. Check out Birdnest from GAE branch and put it to the Application path from (2). eg. /var/nest/birdnest

4. Create a name with `passenger_wsgi.py` as the bootstrap script. And put following code in the file

{{{
import os, sys
path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "birdnest"))
sys.path.insert(0, path)
import code
code.init_logger()
app = code.app
application = code.application
}}}

5. Test your application by navigate to http://nest.onedd.net/text/help/test.json

= Conclusion =
Phusion Passenger helps us deploy birdnest easily. We don't need any other requirements like in cgi mode. Anyway, I'd recommend anyone to use mod_wsgi in production because Passenger WSGI support is just proof-of-concept so no guarantee in performance and reliablity in WSGI.
